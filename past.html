		<i>The metric entropy of the Bolyai-Renyi map.</i>
	      </li>
	      <li>
		Abstract: We will discuss an example of an interval map described by Boyai and further analyzed by Renyi.
		This is used in expanding numbers as repeated square roots. 
		The map has an absolutely continuous invariant probability measure whose entropy is 
		equal to its Lyapunov exponent.  We will give estimates on this value.  
		This is joint work with Julia Slipantschuk.

		<i>Mass transference principle and inhomogeneous measures.</i>
	      </li>
	      <li>
		Abstract:
		In metric Diophantine approximation, one classically studies the size of sets of points being
		infinitely many often close from elements of a sequence \((x_n)\) of points of interests
		(such as rationals, the orbit of a point under a dynamical system, etc...).
		Classical tools to achieve such studies are the so-called "Mass transference
		principles" developped by  Bersnevich-Velani, Barral-Seuret, Jaffard, Koivusalo-Rams and many others.
		In this talk I will present a general mass transference principle which establishes
		both an upper-bound and a lower-bound  suited for the case where the ambient measure
		is only assumed to be finite and some applications to shrinking targets on fractals.

		<i>The trouble with defining perimeter in a nested fractal.</i>
	      </li>
	      <li>
		Abstract: In the 1920s, Caccioppoli observed that the perimeter of a Euclidean Borel 
		set could be characterized in terms of the bounded variation measure of certain functions. 
		Since then, several approaches have been developed to define an analogue version of 
		these measures beyond the Euclidean setting, for instance through the upper gradients of 
		Koskela and Shanmugalingam, Korevaar-Schoen-type functionals, or heat semigroups &agrave; la Ledoux.
		This talk will review some of these characterizations in the context of general metric 
		measure spaces and in particular explain an oscillatory phenomenon that occurs when the
		underlying space is an unbounded planar nested fractal.

		<i>Overlapping random self-similar sets on the line.</i>
	      </li>
	      <li>
		Abstract: The Mandelbrot percolation fractal in \(\mathbb{R}^d\) is constructed
		inductively as follows. We fix an integer \(M\geq 2\) and a probability
		\(p\in(0,1)\).
		The closed unit cube is divided into \(M^d\) congruent sub-cubes, each of which is
		independently retained with probability \(p\) and discarded with probability \(1-p\).
		This process is repeated in the retained cubes <i>ad infinitum</i>, or until there
		are no cubes left. The Mandelbrot percolation process restricted to the building
		blocks of a sponge yields a random sponge. We consider the rational projections of
		random sponges into lines from the perspective of Hausdorff dimension, positivity of
		Lebesgue measure and existence of interior points. In contrast to Mandelbrot
		percolation, the inhomogeneity of the sponge yields qualitatively different
		phenomena. 
		<br>
		This is based on joint work with K&aacute;roly Simon.

		Abstract:
		An important and multi-faceted problem in geometric measure theory is understanding
		incidences between \(\delta\)-tubes and \(\delta\)-balls. The Furstenberg set problem is
		a concrete instance of this problem. I will present some \(\epsilon\)-improvements on
		the previously known bounds for Furstenberg sets, obtained in collaborations with T.

	      <li>
		Abstract: We study self-affine measures on Bedford McMullen carpets. The
		multifractal spectrum assesses the size of sets of points for which the local
		dimension takes a prescribed value.  We make a refinement to the known spectrum that
		takes into account points for which the local dimension does not necessarily exist
		by considering upper and lower symbolic local dimension. For carpets on a \(n \times
		2\)
		grid, and the measure that assigns mass uniformly on rectangles, we exhibit
		different behaviour from that seen when the refined spectrum is computed for
		self-similar sets.

		<i>Dimensions of self-affine carpets.</i>
	      </li>
	      <li>
		Abstract: For self-affine carpets, different notions of fractal dimension such as
		Hausdorff, box and Assouad dimension often take different values. In the setting of
		Bedford-McMullen carpets, we will describe some of the methods used to calculate
		these dimensions, as well as two other dimension spectra, namely the Assouad
		spectrum and intermediate dimensions, which provide more refined local and global
		geometric information about the sets. For more general carpets of Lalley-Gatzouras
		type, the Assouad spectrum can display more interesting behaviour. This talk is
		based on joint work with Jonathan Fraser and Istv&aacute;n Kolossv&aacute;ry.

		<i>Dimensions of projected sets and measures on
		  typical self-affine sets.</i>
	      </li>
	      <li>
		Abstract:  Let \(\{T_ix+a_i\}_{i=1}^\ell\) be an iterated function system on \({\Bbb
		R}^d\) consisting
		of invertible affine maps with \(\|T_i\|<1/2\),
		and \(\pi:\{1,\ldots,\ell\}^{\Bbb N}\to {\Bbb R}^d\) the
		corresponding coding map. For every Borel set \(E\) and
		every Borel probability measure \(\mu\) in the coding space,
		we determine the various dimensions of their projections
		under \(\pi\) for typical translations \((a_1,\ldots,
		a_\ell)\); in particular, we give a necessary and
		sufficient condition on \(\mu\) so that the typical
		projection of \(\mu\) is exact dimensional. This extends the
		known results in the literature on typical projections of
		invariant sets and invariant measures. It plays an
		analogue to the classical theorems for fractal dimensions
		under orthogonal projections.
		<br>  The talk is based on joint
		work with Chiu-Hong Lo and Cai-Yun Ma.

		<i>On local structure of self-conformal measures.</i>
	      </li>
	      <li>
		Abstract:
		A fundamental concept in analysis is that of tangent. Tangents capture the local
		structure of an object but are often much more regular, and by studying the collection
		of tangents at every point one can obtain information on global properties of the
		object. A similar idea holds for measures: One can obtain very strong statements on
		global geometric properties of a measure by studying the sequences of measures, called
		"sceneries", obtained by "zooming in" around typical points for the measure. In our
		recent work with Bal&aacute;zs B&aacute;r&aacute;ny, Antti K&auml;enm&auml;ki and Meng
		Wu, we study the sceneries of
		self-conformal measures in the absence of any separation conditions. It turns out that
		on the line, these measures are always uniformly scaling, meaning that the sceneries at
		typical points share similar statistics almost everywhere. As one corollary, we obtain
		that typical numbers for self-conformal measures are always normal in most bases.

		Abstract: In recent years there has been an explosion of interest and progress on the
		Fourier decay problem for fractal measures. We will survey some of these results and
		remaining open problems, focusing on self-similar measures. We will also outline a
		method to tackle this problem for smooth images of the measure, when the IFS in question
		has non-cyclic contraction ratios.<br>
